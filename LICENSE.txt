You agree to pay phrounz (François Braud) a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually 
attributable to each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other 
person or legal entity, as follows:

a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and
all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;

b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content,
microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end
users for use with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product
or made externally but which directly affect the operation of the Product;

c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly
associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign,
if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty
obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on
additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise); and

f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product (unless excluded below).

However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:

1. The first $300.00 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar quarter;

2. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed
using the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a
contractor-developed in-house training simulator);

3. Revenue from a Product which solely relies on the Licensed Technology for production
of non-interactive linear media (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons,
or movies) and which is Distributed in a form that does not contain or, in order to
deliver, rely on servers running the Licensed Technology;

4. Revenue from a Product which is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as through
the Marketplace);

5. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded
information (such as QR codes) which affects the operation of the Product (e.g., comic books,
soundtracks, apparel);

6. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;

7. Revenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Product access or in-Product
benefits; and

8. Revenue from interactive amusement park rides or coin-operated arcade games which use
the Licensed Technology.
